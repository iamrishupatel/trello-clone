## Tech used

- SvelteKit
- TypeScript
- Appwrite Cloud (Version 1.1.2)
- Tailwindcss
- Flowbite
- Quill Editor

## Setting Up Local Environment

### 1. Clone the repo

To get started, clone this repository and install the dependencies using `pnpm` or `yarn` or `npm`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamrishupatel/trello-clone.git
cd trello-clone
pnpm install
```

### 2. Setup Appwrite

**A. Login and create the project**

1. Login to [Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/) or you can use docker to run a local instance of appwrite. Read about [here](https://appwrite.io/docs/self-hosting)
2. Create a project from the dashboard

**B. Initialize Auth**

3. Enable Email/Password,, anonymous auth and Team Invites as the we use teams for private boards.

**C. Setup Database**

4. Create a database
5. Create 7 collections - (user, board, label, priority, status, task, comment)

> **Note: Don't forget to update the collection permissions so authorized users are allowed to update collections. This also is required to create users in the user collection. For more information about 
Appwrite collection permissions see their [documentation](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/databases/permissions)**

**D. Add following attributes in the tables**

> Note: Set each attribute to be size 1024 bytes in order to accomodate the strings submitted in each field, otherwise user submissions will fail when the API call is made.

6. User Collection Attributes

   | Key                      |  Type  | Default Value |
   | :----------------------- | :----: | :-----------: |

13. Create three storage buckets to store images related to profile_pictures, boards, and tasks, respectively.

### 3. Developing

After appwrite setup is done dependencies are installed with `pnpm install` (or `npm install` or `yarn`).

1. Create an `.env.local` file and copy the contents of `.env.example` and add all the required values.

2. Start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
