Each list can hold items (cards) that represent ideas or tasks.
There 4 lists here:

- **Backlog 🤔:**  Ideas are created here. Here people can describe the idea following three simple questions: Why you wish to do it, What it is, how can you do it. 

- **In Progress📚:** Once the ideas is clearly defined, the task can move to #todo stage. Here the owner of the idea can move to #doing once s/he is ready. He can also wait a bit for other members to join.

- **In Review ⚙️:** On-going  

- **Completed 🙌:** Finished  

You could add other lists like labels holding labels (with colors) in order to tag each card by a label if you wish.`,
